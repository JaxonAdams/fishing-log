## Description
This web application is a functional fishing log, allowing anyone to add the fish they catch and some additional information to keep track of what's been catching fish lately. It uses my own server and APIs. It uses a MySQL database, with Sequelize used as an Object Relational Mapper.
    


## Usage
When you log a catch, please enter information in each requested field, as this will help you find your catch later on. On the proper page, you can filter our list of caught fish to just the fish you have caught, a specific fishing location, a specific lure, or any combination of these filters.
